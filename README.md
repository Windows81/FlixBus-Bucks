Run this to collect the latest FlixBus currency biases:

FlixBus does service in lots of different countries. They change their prices depending on which of the company's regional websites you're using.

Of course, not all prices are made equally. To my knowledge, only transactions paid with USD, GBP, or EUR incur an additional service fee. Also, currencies shift up or down with each other.

I've observed that using FlixBus with USD is the most expensive option (don't forget the $3.99 service fee) whereas using CAD is the best deal for you. The latter costs only 93% as much.
